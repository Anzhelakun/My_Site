        <h2>Story</h2>
        <p>The story of Genshin Impact takes place in the world of Teyvat, which is home to seven major nations: Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma, Sumeru, Fontaine, Natlan, and Snezhnaya. These nations are ruled over by deities known as Archons, part of a group of gods called "The Seven." Each Archon is associated with one of the seven elements of Teyvat, which are also reflected in their nation's landscape and culture.</p>

 <p>Genshin Impact is a massive game that throws players into a world where the Archons rule over the land, and elemental visions are granted to worthy mortals. The game follows the Traveler as they go on a quest to find their missing sibling with the companion Paimon. Armed with the power to tap into the elements without a vision, the Traveler breaks all the laws within Teyvat and performs near-impossible feats.</p>

 <p>To find their sibling, they must venture to all seven regions and learn the hidden truth surrounding the world. On the journey, Traveler and Paimon discover numerous secrets that define the laws of Teyvat, and the history of the Archon War is also slowly revealed to them.</p>
