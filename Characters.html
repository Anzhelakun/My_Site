        <h2>Favourite Characters</h2>
        <p>There are a lot of different characters in the game, and more and more are released with each update. However, I want to show a few of my favorite characters. They are all from different regions, each has its own ability and each has its own element.</p>

                    <h3>Furina</h3>
                    <p>Introduced as the flamboyant and overconfident Hydro Archon, Furina's theatrics are eventually revealed to be a public persona, which she later discards in favor of living a relatively humbler life as an actress.</p>

                    <h3>Neuvelette</h3>
                    <p>Neuvillette is the Iudex of Fontaine, and the leader of the Marechaussee Phantom. While Neuvillette upholds the rules of the court with utmost reverence, he is quite aloof when dealing with human emotions and often distances himself from the public eye.</p>

                    <h3>Hu Tao</h3>
                    <p>Hu Tao's antics and eccentricity belies her role as the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor and her talent as a poet. Nevertheless, she treats the parlor's operations with utmost importance, and holds funeral ceremonies with the highest dignity and solemnity.</p>
